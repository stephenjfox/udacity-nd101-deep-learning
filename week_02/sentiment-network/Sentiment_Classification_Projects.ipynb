    "* Neutral words, which don't really convey any sentiment because you would expect to see them in all sorts of reviews – like \"the\" – have values very close to 1. A perfectly neutral word – one that was used in exactly the same number of positive reviews as negative reviews – would be almost exactly 1. The `+1` we suggested you add to the denominator slightly biases words toward negative, but it won't matter because it will be a tiny bias and later we'll be ignoring words that are too close to neutral anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, the ratios tell us which words are used more often in postive or negative reviews, but the specific values we've calculated are a bit difficult to work with. A very positive word like \"amazing\" has a value above 4, whereas a very negative word like \"terrible\" has a value around 0.18. Those values aren't easy to compare for a couple of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Right now, 1 is considered neutral, but the absolute value of the postive-to-negative rations of very postive words is larger than the absolute value of the ratios for the very negative words. So there is no way to directly compare two numbers and see if one word conveys the same magnitude of positive sentiment as another word conveys negative sentiment. So we should center all the values around netural so the absolute value fro neutral of the postive-to-negative ratio for a word would indicate how much sentiment (positive or negative) that word conveys.\n",
    "* When comparing absolute values it's easier to do that around zero than one. \n",

    "**TODO:** Go through all the ratios you calculated and convert their values using the following formulas:\n",
    "> * For any postive words, convert the ratio using `np.log(ratio)`\n",
    "> * For any negative words, convert the ratio using `-np.log(1/(ratio + 0.01))`\n",
    "\n",
    "That second equation may look strange, but what it's doing is dividing one by a very small number, which will produce a larger positive number. Then, it takes the `log` of that, which produces numbers similar to the ones for the postive words. Finally, we negate the values by adding that minus sign up front. In the end, extremely positive and extremely negative words will have positive-to-negative ratios with similar magnitudes but oppositite signs."

    "* Copy the `SentimentNetwork` class from the previous project into the following cell.\n",
    "* Modify `pre_process_data`:\n",
    ">* Add two additional parameters: `min_count` and `polarity_cutoff`\n",
    ">* Calculate the positive-to-negative ratios of words used in the reviews. (You can use code you've written elsewhere in the notebook, but we are moving it into the class like we did with other helper code earlier.)\n",
    ">* Andrew's solution only calculates a postive-to-negative ratio for words that occur at least 50 times. This keeps the network from attributing too much sentiment to rarer words. You can choose to add this to your solution if you would like.  \n",
    ">* Change so words are only added to the vocabulary if they occur in the vocabulary more than `min_count` times.\n",
    ">* Change so words are only added to the vocabulary if the absolute value of their postive-to-negative ratio is at least `polarity_cutoff`\n",
    "* Modify `__init__`:\n",
    ">* Add the same two parameters (`min_count` and `polarity_cutoff`) and use them when you call `pre_process_data`"
